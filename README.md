# Hello and welcome to using Hapijs with MapBox+AirTable!

[Live site](https://mapping-images.glitch.me/)

This project includes a Node.js server script

- Make sure to set all your [.env](https://support.glitch.com/t/how-do-i-set-environment-variables/3921) variables, this example uses personal tokens
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.
- You will need to generate a free MapBox gljs API key [MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/install/).
- You will need to generate a free AirTable API key [AirTable](https://airtable.com/)
- You should probably get a free HERE free geocode API Key (limit 1000 API calls per day) [HERE](https://platform.here.com/portal/).
- This project uses the [Hapijs](https://hapi.dev/) framework (I hope it makes you as happy as it does for me to use üòÅ) and explores basic routes.
- **Do not use this in production**


## Sample AirTable Format
```
Id,Approved,Photo,PublicText,Latitude,Longitude,SubmissionDate,ApprovalDate
UUID, checkbox, url, text, number (6), number (6), utc date, FORMULA = IF(Approved = 1, LAST_MODIFIED_TIME(), BLANK())

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/map.html`: Holds the display map rendering.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `index.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end, one to return the homepage and one to update with the submitted color. Each one sends data to a Handlebars template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

‚Üê `routes/`: This folder holds all the predefined Swagger entry points for hapijs to communicate with the OwnerRez API.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder holds general server side helper files for working with hapijs.
